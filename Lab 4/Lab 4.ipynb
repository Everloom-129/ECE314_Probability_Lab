As you've probably noticed in previous labs, some questions may require more than just code. You can create new cells and designate their type as markdown in order to do this. I would suggest learning the basics of LaTex so that you can more easily represent your mathematical thought process. You can use LaTex syntax by placing it between two dollar signs in a markdown cell."

We require two things of the standarized version: a mean of zero and a variance of one. If we let $X$ be the standardized form of $Y$ then $X = \\frac{Y-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y},$ where $\\mu_Y$ is the mean of $Y$ and $\\sigma_Y^2$ is the variance of $Y.$ Let's check this:\n",

For example, suppose $Y$ is a non-standard variable and $X$ is the standardized version of Y, and suppose we want to determine the CDF of Y but only have the CDF of X. We can determine the CDF by the following:\n",

    "The Gamma distribution is a particular case of the normal distribution, which describes many life events including predicted rainfall, the reliability of mechanical tools and machines, or any applications that only have positive results. Unfortunately, these applications are often unbalanced, which explains the Gamma distribution’s skewed shape. At its core, the Gamma distribution is used to describe the time until an event occurs, given a certain rate at which events happen. It is characterized by two parameters: the shape parameter $k$ (also known as $\\alpha$), and the rate parameter $\\theta$ (also known as $\\beta$). In each of these forms, both parameters are positive real numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The shape parameter $k$ describes how many events the distribution describes. For example, if we use the Gamma distribution to describe the probability of car accidents in a particular city by modeling four accidents, the shape parameter will be four. The scale parameters $\\theta$ describe the time interval between the events we are modeling. If we use the car accidents example again, we want to measure the time between the four accidents, so we’ll use the average time between those accidents. The scale parameter controls the height of the distribution’s peak. The higher the value of the scale distribution, the more spread it will be, which means it will have a lower peak. However, if the scale parameter is small, the distribution will contract and the peak will be larger.\n",
